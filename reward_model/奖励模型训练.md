│ Answer: Cypress trees produce seeds in cones. The     │                                                        │                  │

│ Answer: Cypress trees produce seeds in cones. The     │                                                        │                  │
│ cones are the reproductive structures of the tree,    │                                                        │                  │
│ and they contain the seeds. The seeds are released    │                                                        │                  │

│ dispersed by the wind. This process allows cypress    │                                                        │                  │
